# ☀️ About

Miami NFT Buildathon brings together world-class talent & industry-leading NFT startups in Miami for a three day innovation festival to **tackle specific problem spaces, optimize hiring processes, & seamlessly assemble the future superstars of your organization!** 

While most hackathons consist of many people packed into a single room, **we segment the experience through nodes** to match companies with talent they are most interested in. Nodes are **intimate innovation pods** hosted by sponsors (either in an on-campus facility or an approved off-campus location) comprised of 15-30 hackers **hand-picked** by your team -- no need to sift through hundreds of builders at the event! Each node is essentially it’s own mini-hackathon within the event.

Curate the vibe & experience of your node to match that of your company. Nodes are the ultimate blank canvas for you to build an **unforgettable hackathon experience** for those you host.

## Why Host a Node?

### 🙋‍♀️ *Recruitment*

If you run an NFT technology company or lab, you may have noticed it is hard to find passionate talent that recognizes the space’s potential. That’s where we come in! Miami NFT Week pulls the best and brightest worldwide to be together, in Miami, for the 3 day celebration and innovation sprint. See how these hackers approach the problem spaces they’re exposed to and recruit from the cream of the crop.

### 💡 *Innovation*

Miami NFT Week provides the ultimate environment for a collision of great ideas. Our incredible cast of mentors and focus on design thinking offers a mini-incubator for some truly unique projects. There’s a problem out there that your product can solve. We’re here to make that connection.

### 🗣 *Brand Awareness*

Suppose you lead your community or ecosystem from being a layer 1 blockchain to presenting a game-breaking NFT community to the market. In that case, the brand awareness and community support from Miami NFT Week is a great way to build dev relations, grow your audience, and educate new users.

# 📍Where?

The BUILDathon’s HQ will be in the heart of Downtown Miami at **Miami Dade College (MDC) Wolfson Campus**. Campus features include:

- Minutes away from Wynwood, Brickell, FTX Arena
- State-of-the-Art facilities such as the BIT (Business Innovation & Technology) Center
